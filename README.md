# Tree_Cover_Model

## Objective
Predict the forest cover type (most common kind of tree cover) based on cartographic variables. 

Keras is being used to classify the data into 7 types, as listed below 
* Spruce/Fir
* Lodgedole Pine 
* Ponderosa Pine
* Cottonwood/Willow
* Aspen 
* Douglas-fir
* Krummholz

## How?
WIP! Will be updated as things move on.

## Strange Things
Carrying out training on an Apple Silicon Mac. Hence, one or two potential issues with requirements. To address.
